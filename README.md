# File Organizer
This is a File Organizer module that I made with Python to help me sort out my files, and while creating different scripts to do organizing for different purposes, I decided to make it extendable just to make it faster.

Honestly, this is not well thought out but It was enough to get my purpose done and I am pretty sure there're modules that already assist with this, but this is just  for practice.

## How to use
```
from FileManager import Directory, File
file = File("AbsolutePath")
directory = Directory("AbsolutePath")
```
